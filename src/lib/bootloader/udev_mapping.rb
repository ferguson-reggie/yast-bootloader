    # Here is description of strategy for finding the best possible udev persistent name.
    # There are three scenarios we consider:
    # S1. disk with boot configuration is moved to different PC
    # S2. disk dies and its content is loaded to new disk from backup
    # S3. path to disk dies and disk is moved to different one
    #
    # Strategy is:
    #
    # 1. if device have filesystem and it have its mount_by, then respect it
    # 2. if there is by-label use it, as it allows to handle S1, S2 and S3 just with using same
    #    label
    # 3. if there is by-uuid then use it as it can also handle S1, S2 and S3 as uuid can be
    #    changed, but it is harder to do
    # 4. if there is by-id use it, as it can handle S3 in some scenarios, but not always.
    # 5. if there is by-path use it as it is last supported udev symlink that at least prevent
    #    change of kernel device during boot
    # 6. as fallback use kernel name
    #
    # @param dev [String] device udev or kernel one like /dev/disk/by-id/blabla
    # @raise when device have udev format but do not exists
    # @return [String] udev name
